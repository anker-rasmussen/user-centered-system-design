# User centered system design
## Session 1
Interactive systems and technologies are all around us nowadays. Human Computer Interaction is a discipline concerned with studying how humans interact with computing systems. 

Technology should provide good usability and leave the user feeling a positive user experience.

Users and developers should understand the context of the software they use and create.

Successful user-facing technology is created by understanding the goals and behaviors of the current users, by including them in the design process.

It's important to iterate on designs by progressively improving testing with users and learning from the evaluations.

Interactive systems deal with transmission, display, or transmission of information. Technologies range from components, devices, products, and software systems. Devices and systems that respond dynamically are included, but so are cameras, buildings, etc..

Devices that allow users to create inputs and initiate actions are *input*

Devices that show the data that has been input and what has happened to it (presenting results) are *output*

Types of interaction
- Instructing
- Conversing
- Manipulating
- Exploring 
- Responding

Types of input devices
- Keyboard/keypad
- Pointing devices
- Touch and gesture
- Voice input
- Sensors, cameras, fingerprint scanners, barcode readers etc...

Output devices
- Visual displays
- Auditory output
- Haptic and tactile output
- Olfactory/Gustatory
- Ambient/peripheral output
- Print/tangible output

Where are the principles applied?
- Apps/Websites
- Smart TVs
- Smart speakers
- Games consoles (ps5 xbox etc..)
- Computer games
- VR worlds
- Medical systems
- Flight control room
- Spacecraft
- Cars
- Wearables

### Usability
The extent to which a product can be used to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

- User
- Goals
- Context of use
- Effectiveness
- Efficiency
- Satisfaction

Why does usability matter?

Systems that have poor usability cause
- Frustration/stress/fatigue to the user
- Inefficiencies in workflows, causing costs and user errors
- Unsafe systems
- Systems that are underused!

### User Experience

User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction. The first requirement is to meet the exact needs of the end user without fuss or bother. Simplicity and elegance are the following. 

### Context
- Who uses the technology?
- What are they using it for?
- Where are they using it?
- What is the environment?
- What might make it more challenging?
- What frame of mind?
- What experience do they want?
- What expectations may they have?
- What support may they need?
