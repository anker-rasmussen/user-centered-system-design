# User centered system design
## Session 1
Interactive systems and technologies are all around us nowadays. Human Computer Interaction is a discipline concerned with studying how humans interact with computing systems. 

Technology should provide good usability and leave the user feeling a positive user experience.

Users and developers should understand the context of the software they use and create.

Successful user-facing technology is created by understanding the goals and behaviors of the current users, by including them in the design process.

It's important to iterate on designs by progressively improving testing with users and learning from the evaluations.

Interactive systems deal with transmission, display, or transmission of information. Technologies range from components, devices, products, and software systems. Devices and systems that respond dynamically are included, but so are cameras, buildings, etc..

Devices that allow users to create inputs and initiate actions are *input*

Devices that show the data that has been input and what has happened to it (presenting results) are *output*

Types of interaction
- Instructing
- Conversing
- Manipulating
- Exploring 
- Responding

Types of input devices
- Keyboard/keypad
- Pointing devices
- Touch and gesture
- Voice input
- Sensors, cameras, fingerprint scanners, barcode readers etc...

Output devices
- Visual displays
- Auditory output
- Haptic and tactile output
- Olfactory/Gustatory
- Ambient/peripheral output
- Print/tangible output

Where are the principles applied?
- Apps/Websites
- Smart TVs
- Smart speakers
- Games consoles (ps5 xbox etc..)
- Computer games
- VR worlds
- Medical systems
- Flight control room
- Spacecraft
- Cars
- Wearables

### Usability
The extent to which a product can be used to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.

- User
- Goals
- Context of use
- Effectiveness
- Efficiency
- Satisfaction

Why does usability matter?

Systems that have poor usability cause
- Frustration/stress/fatigue to the user
- Inefficiencies in workflows, causing costs and user errors
- Unsafe systems
- Systems that are underused!

### User Experience

User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction. The first requirement is to meet the exact needs of the end user without fuss or bother. Simplicity and elegance are the following. 

### Context
- Who uses the technology?
- What are they using it for?
- Where are they using it?
- What is the environment?
- What might make it more challenging?
- What frame of mind?
- What experience do they want?
- What expectations may they have?
- What support may they need?


## Session 2

### System centered -> User centered

In 1985 there was a paradigm shift, moving from what can the system do to what does the user need to do, and how can the UI help them accomplish their goals?

### Process
How design work is organized and delivered
Several different frameworks exist, and there's no single "correct" one. This is because they emphasise different priorities and have their own drawbacks and advantages.

They can be used in conjunction or adapted.

### Key activities
| Phase | Stage Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Understand and specify the context of use** | User research | Find out about users (who, what, when, where, and how). |
| **Define design goals and requirements** | Definition | Derive high-level goals and specify constraints. |
| **Produce design solutions** | Conceptual design (ideation) & Detailed design (Prototyping) | Ideation and concept generation; development and design with prototyping. |
| **Evaluate design** | Evaluation | Test/evaluate what's being designed, both during and throughout the process. |



## Desigining is an iterative process

There are cycles of designing, evaluating, and researching, as well as improving and eliminating alternative designs. Design won't be perfect the first time.

Alternative designs are tested individually and against eachother. Give your ideas competition.

Design involves concpetual and detailed design; explore lots of ideas to get the concept right, then get the detail done right. (Explore a lot of designs!)

### Evaluation steps

- User research ⇔ Evaluate existing systems
- Conceptual design ⇔ Evaluate ideas or prototypes
- Detailed design ⇔ Evaluate design prototypes

You can look at competitors too!


### Aims of user research

- Who uses the product? (abilities, views, etc..)
- What do they do (how and why?)
- Find out about where and when they do these
- Identify opportunities for design
- Design goals, collate requirements and constraints..

### Design aims:

Conceptual:
- Generate ideas
- Explore alternatives (preferably more)
- Get user feedback on designs
- Envision users activities (present & future)
- Make highlevel decisions (modes of interaction, types of interface, tasks to support, workflows, etc..)

Detailed:
- Choose alternatives & refine
- Design the details of presentation and interaction
- Create interactive prototypes
- Refine existing designs (through evaluation - user feedback and fixing them)
- Specify and document design decisions


### User research techniques

- Interviews
- Empathy maps
- Observations
- Affinity mapping
- Questionnaires
- User journey maps
- Personas

### Evaluation techniques
- Usability testing
- Prototyping
- Questionnaires
- Interviews
- Metrics (usability & UX)

### Classic user centered design

Understand context of use -> Specify user requirements -> Design solutions -> Evaluate against requirements

Empathize -> Define -> Ideate -> Prototype -> Test

- Explore the problem, understand your users to decompose their experiences and motivations
- Identify the core problems from the perspective of the user
- Brainstorm ideas to solve the problems
- Produce scaled down versions of the product
- Run tests (and possibly iterate)

### Double diamond framework

- R&D (research and design) are two diamonds
- Discover (Diverge) -> Define (Converge)-> Develop (Diverge) -> Deliver (Converge)

### Design sprint

- Understand -> Define -> Sketch -> Decide -> Prototype -> Validate

### Considerations
- Minimize bias by being aware of your bias! Don't be the only researcher
- Set goals
- Identify participants
- Determine your relationship with participants
- Ethical considerations
- Triangluation 
- Pilot studies


### Observing users
- Direct observation; watch them using your tool
    - Focuses on user actions and changes of state
    - Valuable technique for fidning out what people do rather than what they say they do.
    - Yields detailed information esp. for verbalisation
    - Supplement with other techniques such as interviews.
- Where?
    - In the field
    - Natural environment
    - In the lab
    - Controlled environment
- Naturalistic observation; watch them use your tool in a real world setting
    - Researcher does not manipulate the activity
    - Researcher does not manipulate the setting
    - Sampling bias? If in a tube station at rush hour - are people older/younger? Or working age.
    - Think about when, what, where, who to observe.

### How?

- Be clear about why you're observing
- Select a framework
- Decide how to record
- Think about access and ethics
- Capture the details (writing, camera, etc..!)
- Highlight and seperate personal opinion from objective fact
- Consider working as a team (confirm observations with another teammate)
- Check your notes and write them up (same day! don't let memory decay)


### Types of recording:

| Method | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Note taking** | • Not intrusive<br>• Flexible | • Difficult to listen/observe and write concurrently<br>• Biases creep in<br>• Handwriting is slow and can be difficult to decipher |
| **Audio recording** | • Less intrusive than video<br>• Easier to pay attention than note taking<br>• Evocative | • Transcribing is laborious<br>• Equipment can fail<br>• Background interference<br>• People talking over each other |
| **Photography** | • Can supplement other techniques | • Not that useful by itself<br>• Needs permission |
| **Video** | • Visual and audio data<br>• Attention-light<br>• Rich detail for later review | Intrusive<br>• Same disadvantages as audio recording |
